  <a href="{{site.wvu_site}}">WVU Research Computing Summer Lectures</a>
  aims to help researchers optimize their interaction with our
  High-Performance Computing clusters.
  The workshop will be teaching them basic HPC research computing.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including accesing the cluster, submit jobs, containers, version control, 
  data management, and parallel programming.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
  This workshop is not aimed to HPC system administrators or advanced Scientific
  software developers, the concepts are presented to offer a pragmatic overview
  of several topics, knowledge that can be transfered directly to current research
  projects.
